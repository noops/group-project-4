# San Francisco Crime Predictor


Selected Topic:

We selected this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/sanfranciso-crime-dataset. Our goal is to use machine learing to predict crimes. This topic was selected because we think we can create a binary classifier that will decide whether or not a person will be arrested and booked based on the crime committed.

Description of the data source:

The CSV file obtained from kaggle.com contains 13 columns and 150,500 rows. This data includes geographic data that will be mapped to show the areas where crimes happen.
