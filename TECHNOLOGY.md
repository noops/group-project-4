# **Technologies Used** 

## **Data Cleaning and Analysis** 

**Pandas** is the primary tool used for initial data analysis and cleaning of this data set. Pandas is a powerful library within the Python  programming language  that allows analyzing, organizing, sorting, filtering, pivoting, aggregating, calculating, a data set. Additional datal analysis will be executed using **Python** and its associated packages. 

## **Database Storage**

Our team will utilize **PostgreSQL** to store data acquired for this project. **PostgreSQL** is a reliable and powerful, open source object-relational database system that is very suitable for this project.

## **Machine Learning**

A variety of machine learning models are being evaluated to evaluate the limitations and benefits of each prior to making a determination. We will utilize **Scikit-learn** as a classifier. 

## **Dashboard**

Several different approaches to data display are in evaluation including initial data analysis with tools such as **Matplotlib.** Further visualiztion tools may include Plotly or Tableau.  These visualiztions will be used to create an interactive dashboard. While the approach to this dashboard is currently being selected, one approach to host this content is through **Github Pages**.
