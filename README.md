![](./images/sf_img.jpg)


## Selected Topic
Our group selected the San Francisco Crime Dataset for the following reasons:
1. The data is clear and easy to understand. 
2. The data is large enough to support different predictions.
3. Data visualizations can be easily produced.

## Description of the Source of Data
We obtained the data from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/sanfranciso-crime-dataset in the form of a CSV file. 
- It contains 13 columns and 150,500 rows
- The data provides information such as the day, time, location, description, resolution, etc. of the crimes reported.

## Goals and Information We Hope to Answer
Our goal is to use a machine learning model to predict outcomes based on the data we have. The following are some questions we hope to answer:
1. Can we predict whether or not a person will be arrested and booked based on their crime?
2. Are we able to predict the type/category of crime based on the day, time and location of the crime?
3. Can we predict if certain areas are more lenient/strict than others when it comes to their outcomes based on the resolution and location?
